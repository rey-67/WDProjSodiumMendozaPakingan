    <h2>Game Progression</h2>

<p>
This guide focuses on the early part of the game, but it helps to understand how Minecraft progresses overall. Progression in Minecraft is not very linear. It mostly depends on gathering different materials that unlock new tools and abilities. For example, a wooden pickaxe lets you mine stone, which lets you make stone tools and a furnace. With a furnace, you can smelt iron. An iron pickaxe lets you get diamonds, and a diamond pickaxe can mine almost anything.
</p>

<p>
Farming works the same way. Growing crops lets you breed animals, which give different resources. Enemy drops also have their uses, and as you gather more materials from mining and farming, you can start enchanting gear. Building structures is also a major part of the game, both for survival and creativity.
</p>

<p>
After progressing through the Overworld, you can eventually build a Nether portal. The Nether gives you stronger materials, potion ingredients, and the items needed to reach the End. In the End, defeating the Ender Dragon unlocks the outer islands, where you can find an elytra for flying and shulker boxes for extra storage. There are also optional bosses like elder guardians and the Wither.
</p>

<h2>First Day</h2>

<p>
At the start, your goals are simple. Look around to understand your surroundings and move if needed. Gather wood and make your first tools. Get stone, craft better tools, find coal or make charcoal, and secure a shelter before night.
</p>

<p>
Optional early tasks include getting food, collecting wool for a bed, picking up seeds for farming, or mining iron if it is near the surface.
</p>

<p>
Begin by locating trees and breaking logs with your fist. Collect at least five to eight logs so you can make a crafting table, sticks, and your first wooden pickaxe. Don’t bother crafting other wooden tools since stone tools are much better.
</p>

<p>
If there is exposed stone nearby, mine around twenty blocks to craft a full set of stone tools and a furnace. If you see coal ore, mine it. The area you mine might become a simple shelter for the night.
</p>

<p>
Food keeps you alive. Craft a stone sword and kill animals for meat. Cook the meat in your furnace using coal or charcoal. Avoid eating raw food. Once you craft a stone axe, gather more logs; you will need them later.
</p>

<p>
If you want, break tall grass for seeds and kill a few animals for early food, especially sheep for wool. Don’t chase animals too far. If iron is nearby, make sure you use a stone pickaxe to mine it.
</p>

<p>
If you’re near water, you can kill fish for food. Be careful of drowned and always watch your oxygen bar.
</p>

<p>
By late afternoon, start preparing for night. If you have time, plant seeds near water to begin a wheat farm and place a torch nearby. When sunset arrives, head into your shelter or place your bed if you have one.
</p>

<h2>Night Time</h2>

<p>
During your first night, stay in your shelter. Use the time to cook food, smelt iron if you have any, and craft new items. If you made a bed, you can safely skip the night. If you are in a cave, you can mine a bit, but don’t go too deep.
</p>

<p>
Hostile mobs spawn in the dark, so do not wander unless you are prepared to fight. Skeletons are especially dangerous. Witches, creepers, and endermen can kill you early, so avoid them.
</p>

<p>
If you die, you drop all your items. Setting your spawn point with a bed is important. If things go wrong, you can dig a quick three-block hole, cover it, and wait out the night.
</p>

<h2>Shelter</h2>

<p>
A shelter is essential for survival. Before night arrives, find or create a safe place. A small cave with one entrance is ideal. You can block it with fences, walls, or dirt. If you cannot find a cave, dig into a hillside or build a small house.
</p>

<p>
Choose a spot where you can see your surroundings the next morning. Avoid water areas where skeletons might hide. Use fences, doors, ladders, and chests to organize your space. Once you have a bed, sleep in it to set your spawn point.
</p>

<p>
You can travel like a nomad, but carry your crafting table, furnace, and bed.
</p>

<h2>Light</h2>

<p>
Light stops monsters from spawning. Torches are your only early-game light source, so place them around your shelter before night. Torches prevent monsters from spawning within their light range. Solid blocks can block the light, so place torches carefully.
</p>

<h2>Food</h2>

<p>
Food keeps you alive and allows you to heal. Hunger doesn’t drain quickly on the first day, but get some food early. Meat is the best option. Wheat farms are helpful if you start one early.
</p>

<p>
Your hunger drains faster when you sprint, jump, fight, or take damage. At low hunger, you cannot heal or sprint. If hunger empties fully, you begin to starve. You won’t die from starvation except on Hard difficulty.
</p>

<p>
Avoid raw chicken, rotten flesh, spider eyes, and pufferfish. They cause poisoning. If you kill spiders, use the string to craft a fishing rod for steady food.
</p>

<h2>Wood</h2>

<p>
Wood is your most basic and important resource. Break logs by hand and collect at least six to eight to start. You can make planks, sticks, tools, and many items from wood. Each tree type looks different, but all logs work the same.
