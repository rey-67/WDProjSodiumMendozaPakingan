# UPDATED PROPOSAL


## Description

SurviveBlocks is a beginner-friendly website that helps players learn how to survive, build, and explore in Minecraft. It covers crafting, mining, farming, boss fights, and pro mechanics. The goal is to help players go from their first night to beating the Ender Dragon with clear, simple guides and visuals.

## Website Pages

1. **Home** – Introduction to Minecraft and links to all main sections.
2. **Survival** – Crafting, mining, farming, and general gameplay tips.
3. **Bosses & Challenges** – How to fight the Wither, Ender Dragon, Warden, and more.
4. **Areas & Dimensions** – Guides for Overworld, Nether, and End biomes and structures.
5. **Pro Mechanics** – Popular and easy "Pro Mechanics" that you should learn/know.

## JavaScript Feature

* **Day and Night Mode:** A toggle switch (which is the logo) that changes the theme between Dirt (Overworld) and Netherack (Nether).
* **Optional (if we feel motivated):** A simple crafting table simulator that shows what item is made based on placed materials.
